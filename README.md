# Python Pong Game



# Project Overview

This is a classic two-player PONG game, a digital recreation of one of the earliest arcade video games. It's built entirely in Python and uses the built-in Turtle graphics library, making it an excellent, lightweight project for demonstrating basic game development concepts, event handling, and collision detection.

# Features

* Two-Player Local Gameplay: Control the paddles on the left and right sides of the screen.
* Score Keeping: Tracks and displays the scores for both players.
* Collision Detection: Accurate handling of ball bounces off paddles and borders.
* Simple Graphics: Utilizes the easy-to-use Turtle module for drawing the game elements.
